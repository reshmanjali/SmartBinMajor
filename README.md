Smart Bins For Garbage Collection Using IoT
This project is a combination of IoT and Android.
The level of garbage in the dustbin is sensed with the help of ultra-sonic sensor and this data is streamed continuously, with the wi-fi module, to a cloud storage. The cloud platform used in this project is thingSpeak. But you are totally free to choose any cloud of your choice.
According to the garbage level in the bin, SMS alerts are sent to the garbage collector.

An Android app is developed which
  > displays the current level of garbage in the bin in an easily understandable manner
  > navigates the user to the bin with the help of Google Maps
